# smd-proto-board

This repository contains Gerber files for a 100 x 100 mm 2-layer printed circuit board (PCB) containing surface mount device (SMD) adapter designs. It is useful for working with SOIC and TSSOP footprint devices especially. There are some SOT-23 style footprints too.

Note that there are no grooves/scored lines or mouse-bites; the individual adapter boards will need to be cut to be separated.

To order, upload the zip file to a PCB factory website (e.g. jlcpcb.com) and select the lowest-cost 100 x 100 mm service.
