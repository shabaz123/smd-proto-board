# smd-proto-board

This repository contains PCB files (also known as Gerber files) for surface mount device (SMD) breakout boards. There are individual sets of files for the following SMD types:
SOIC
TSSOP
SOT23 / SOT23-5 / SOT23-6

There is also a set of files for a larger 2-layer printed circuit board (PCB) containing multiple SMD designs. Note that there are no grooves/scored lines or mouse-bites; the individual adapter boards will need to be cut to be separated. Cutting will cause dust! Therefore the individual boards are better, and the cost is not much to get the individual boards made. However, for the ultimate low cost, provided you are prepared to cut the boards yourself (for example with a hobby-grade table saw) then the larger board is an option.

To order, select the relevant zip file from this repository, and upload it to a PCB factory website (e.g. jlcpcb.com). The website will automatically detect the zip file content and handle it accordingly.

Here is an example upload using the export-soic-only.zip file:
